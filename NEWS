1.2.0
=====

- New: When using ``uproc-dna`` or ``uproc-prot`` with ``-p``, it is possible
  to control which columns are printed by passing a format string via the new
  ``-F`` // ``--format`` option
- New in `libuproc`: ``uproc_database`` and ``uproc_model`` objects
- New in `libuproc`: Error handler receives a user-defined "context" pointer
  when invoked
- New in `libuproc`: Some of ``uproc_list_*`` are wrapped by macros that
  verify that the size of the passed object matches the list element size.


1.1.2
=====

- Only default to the mmap database format by default on GNU/Linux. Can be
  controlled by passing ``--enable-mmap`` or ``--disable-mmap`` to
  ``./configure``.

1.1.1
=====

- Fix: Wouldn't compile on systems without ``posix_fallocate()``
- Fix: Using -p in single-threaded mode leads to crash

1.1.0
=====

- New: Allow ``-`` as file name in ``uproc-import`` and ``uproc-export`` as
  shortcut for stdin/stdout
- New: ``uproc-import`` and ``uproc-export`` show progress while
  loading and storing ecurves
- Fix: performance issues on some platforms
- New in `libuproc`: ``uproc_ecurve_(load|store)p[sv]?``, report the current
  progress to a callback function while loading or storing ecurves


1.0.2
=====

- Fix: AX_CHECK_ENABLE_DEBUG would cause compilation without optimizations
- Fix: One critical and some minor memory leaks in ``uproc-makedb``
- Fix: ``-V`` / ``--libversion`` would always report ``mmap()`` was present
- Fix: Wrong ORF filtering in ``uproc-dna`` short read mode


1.0.1
=====
